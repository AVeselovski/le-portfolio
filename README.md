# Portfolio | blog?

[ url here ]

This shall act as a personal "portfolio" website. While technically could be categorized as a blog, it really isn't. "Posts" are just ramblings of a madman / personal notes for reference, written in a post format for easier digestion in the future. Helping own forgetfulness in a fun organized way.

Since most, if not all tutorials and docs (including Vercel) on the subject of learning Next revolves around building a blog, the though here was: "Might just as well..."

## NextJS

This is done with NextJS with the purpose of learning & testing out NextJS capabilities. As such, there is blatanly unfinished code, with no intention to do so, questionably useless features (such as image upload), and purposeful inconsistencies in implemetation (i.e. SSG vs SSR VS CSR). For example having API routes and using clientside fetching is absolutely unnecessary here. This is for whoever decides to judge the authors technical / engineering skills based on this repo. Don't. Or do, but be warned.
