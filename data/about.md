**Hi! I'm Artur, nice to meet you. I'm a front-end / full stack software engineer that dabbles in UI design here and there.**

Like your typical front-end developer, I too enjoy building with modern technologies. And while I do have my preferences and strengths, as well as weaknesses, I won't shy away from older / less popular tech-stacks either. I like to think that I'm an engineer first and a technology specialist second, meaning I'm capable of adapting as necessary regardless of the tech.

**Education:** Bachelor of Engineering (AMK).

**Experience:** 4 years of developement experience in a variety of different teams and projects.
