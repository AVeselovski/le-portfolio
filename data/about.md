I'm a software engineer with 4 years of developement experience in a variety of different teams and projects. Though my main focus is frontend development, I'm not totally lost when it comes to full-stack. I also dabble in UI design here and there.

Like your typical frontend developer, I too enjoy building things with modern technologies. While I do have my preferences and strengths, as well as weaknesses, I won't shy away from older / less popular tech-stacks either. I like to think that I'm an engineer first and a technology specialist second, meaning I'm capable of adapting as necessary regardless of the tech.

**Education:** Bachelor of Engineering (AMK).
